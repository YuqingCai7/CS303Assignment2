## Linked List

### Push_Front

The first function to implement into our linked list is the push_front function. Here, I created a linked list called myList, and used push_front to add 3 values: 1, 2, and 3.

As we can see, the numbers were added sucessfully.

### Push_Back

We will also attempt to add numbers from the back of the list by using the push_back function.Which can be seen below:

Here, we can see the original list has added new values: 4, 5, 6 to the back of the list.

### Pop_Front

To delete an item from the beginning of the list, we will use the pop_front function:

Here, we can see that the number 1 no longer exist as it has been removed by pop_front:

### Pop_Back

Similar as the push function, we will also try to delete a number from the back by using the pop_back function:

After using pop_back, the last number, 6, was deleted from the list.

### Front and Back

To check the the first or the last number of the list, we will use the function front and back. Here is a quick overview of the functions:
